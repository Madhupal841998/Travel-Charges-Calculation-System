# Travel-Charges-Calculation-System

A solution to calculate and display travel charges, collection summary, and passenger summary at a station.

## Description

A new metro train has been launched from the New Delhi Railway Station to the Airport. It is a non-stop train, stopping only at the Airport with no intermediate stops. It is also possible to return from the Airport back to the New Delhi Railway Station, also as a non-stop journey.

## ZeroCard

The Metro authority prefers money to be collected via ZeroCard, an electronic payment utility used to pay for metro travel charges. The ZeroCard functions like a wallet loaded with money. Each person traveling in this metro must carry a ZeroCard, and each card has a unique number.

## Travel Charges

Costs for the journey are based on the passenger's age and are categorized as follows:

| Passenger Type  | Charges (₹) |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Kids            | 30          |
| Adults          | 100         |
| Senior Citizen  | 20          |

## Return Journey Discount

Travel charges differ for a single trip and a return journey. When a passenger takes a return journey, there is a discount of 50% on the travel charges for the return journey.

### Example

If a senior citizen travels from New Delhi Railway Station to the Airport, the travel charge collected is ₹20. If the same citizen travels back to New Delhi Railway Station, the amount collected for the return journey is ₹10. If the same citizen travels a third time on the same day, it is treated as a new single journey, and the travel charge collected is ₹20.
